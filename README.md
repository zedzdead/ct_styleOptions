## Instantiating the plugin

As with all jQuery instatiations:

	$( "#product_style_Mens_Chest" ).productStyle();

Where #product_style_Mens_chest is the id of the dropdown you wish to replace with clickable tiles.

This converts this drop-down into radio buttons.  It also identifies in-stock out-of-stock and none stock items for all the other styles on the page.  This enables the simple green red and grey default styles for the corresponding stock states.
